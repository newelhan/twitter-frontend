Tried to replicate a website's front-end, figure it'd be X (Twitter)

Preview: https://newelhan.github.io/x-frontend/

No mobile support...... yet?

This is as close as I can get to recreating X (Twitter)'s front end

REPLICATION ---
- Replicated all elements from the nav, main container, sidebar PIXEL BY PIXEL using CSS with 100% zoom (MOST GUT WRENCHING PART, switching tabs back and forth)
- Copied and screenshotted each of the images from the buttons (Both inactive and active buttons)

Started on 17 July 2024

Finished on 30 August 2024 (Procrastination is no joke)

MADE THE UPLOAD POST ALGORITHM ---
1. Saving the data with JavaScript's Object
2. Randomizing the views (highest), likes, repost, comments (lowest) to make it look like an ACTUAL REAL POST WITH "INTERACTION"

* HANDLING IMAGES AND GIFS
1. You can upload both images and GIFS ONCE
2. You can delete the image and GIF with a button on top of the preview image container at post input

- All designs have been adjusted to laptop / PC's viewport.. not mobile.. yet
